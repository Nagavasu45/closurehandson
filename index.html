    <h3>explaination:In this question we have function with function and function name is counter()
        we call the function outside of the function with assigned to new variable that
        variable name counter and in function we have functional scope varible named as counter=0
        and then in the alret we are calling the inner function and we called 4 times alert(counter())
        and  main funcation have functional scope variable so and we are calling inner function 4 times
        we get 1,2,3,4

        and in the function if count===0 then inside of if block we have one more varible let count=1
        and if we have console.log(count); here we get 1 because of block level scope same name variable there soo
        and  console.log(count) statement wrote at outof the block so we get 0 and inside of the function we donot
        have counter name varible soo check with global level then we find the variable that varible have 0

    <h3>explaination:In this logic we have forloop with setTimeout() with one function log()
        and setTimeout method has 1000milesconds so setTimeout will execute after one second in this for loop
        itarate three times soo finally i value is 3 that's why after completion of one sec we got 3,3,3

    <h2>Q4.	Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should accept parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.

        explaination:here i have taken one outer function and one inner function for getting area of the rectangle
        i have called outer function with parameter length with value '4' and outer function takes the length and 
        return to the inner function ,at the same we called inner function with parameter breadth with value soo outer function result stored in 
        variable soo we called inner function res(5) that's it. finally we got area of trinagle
