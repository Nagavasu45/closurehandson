    <h3>explaination:In this question we have function with function and function name is counter()
        we call the function outside of the function with assigned to new variable that
        variable name counter and in function we have functional scope varible named as counter=0
        and then in the alret we are calling the inner function and we called 4 times alert(counter())
        and  main funcation have functional scope variable so and we are calling inner function 4 times
        we get 1,2,3,4

    <h3>Explaination:In this code we have global variable count=0 and called one annonamous function
        and in the function if count===0 then inside of if block we have one more varible let count=1
        and if we have console.log(count); here we get 1 because of block level scope same name variable there soo
        and  console.log(count) statement wrote at outof the block so we get 0 and inside of the function we donot
        have counter name varible soo check with global level then we find the variable that varible have 0
